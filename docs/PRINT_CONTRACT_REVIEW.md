# SwiftEdit response to candidate P1 print/preview contract

Reviewed 2026-10-01 against File Manager
`orchestrator/spec/contracts/GUI_PRINT_DEVELOPMENT.md` (candidate semantic draft).
This is a consumer reconciliation response, not an implemented API, SDK claim,
owner-selected numeric policy or completion of printing.

## Accept for the candidate boundary

SwiftEdit owns source bytes, document/projection identity, selected ranges,
plain/rendered interpretation and title. GUI.Forms owns page geometry/shaping,
immutable page leases, preview, owned native dialog and spool submission. Neither
side may change editor source, history, selection or save state while printing.
The immutable logical plan must be shared by preview and submission; preview zoom
must not repaginate. Native Print is sufficient explicit intent for that exact
snapshot and final ticket, with no extra confirmation invented by SwiftEdit.

Accept asynchronous production on named executors, bounded outstanding work,
stale-result refusal, old-page retention on replacement failure, and nonblocking
close with owners retained until callbacks/work retire. Accept distinct native
dialog cancellation, cancellation before submission, OS spool acceptance and
partial/unknown outcomes. Never automatically retry an ambiguous submission or
describe spool acceptance as physical printing success.

Native default paper/imageable geometry is preferable to guessing Letter/A4.
One copy, no automatic headers/footers and monochrome source text are reasonable
initial defaults. Twelve-point monospace and 36-point margins remain candidate
defaults subject to native ticket/imageable-area validation, not owner mandates.

## Consumer feasibility and bounded counters

1. **Editable source:** `SessionCopy` can collect owned exact bytes while checking
   document identity/revision before each 64 KiB step. No live Session is called
   from a worker. Publish a print snapshot only after complete collection; edits
   during collection refuse/cancel it. A completed owned copy can outlive edits
   or close and stays labelled with its captured revision. Its initial whole-copy
   reserve is synchronous today; this is not a hard-latency guarantee. The GUI
   still uses its older Document/TextBox path and needs a matching capture adapter
   until Session migration; existing Session code alone does not implement GUI
   printing. Projection and source storage require separately reported capacity.

2. **Paged source:** the current PagedFile/read handle is not an immutable snapshot
   guarantee. Keep `snapshot_unavailable` until a validated owned snapshot/copy
   strategy is implemented. This is an implementation gap, not an accepted product
   limit that removes large-document printing from the remaining work.

3. **Mode:** propose that invoking Print starts with the explicitly active source
   or rendered view mode, and that the owned UI exposes that choice. A rendered
   view must not silently print source merely because plain mode is the service
   default. Distinguish service default from consumer intent. The separate Markdown
   layout preview remains an owned window/dialog, with no source mutation.

4. **Selection:** default to whole document. A selection job must copy ordered
   source ranges under one stamp; never infer them later from a live control.
   For discontiguous ranges, represent boundaries explicitly in the projection
   and tag any consumer-chosen separator as synthetic (no source-byte extent).
   Do not concatenate unrelated endpoints into an invented word or claim the
   separator is document content. Exact selection presentation remains a consumer
   policy to document during implementation, not a newly inferred owner answer.

5. **Projection:** preserve source CRLF as one logical break, standalone CR/LF,
   empty/trailing lines and literal marker text. Invalid bytes and control labels
   use exact source extents distinct from projected UTF-8 positions. Literal
   strings resembling a control label remain ordinary text. Tabs need a declared
   consumer tab-stop rule applied to provider geometry; replacing them with a
   fixed space count before font/layout resolution is insufficient. Please make
   typed tabs or the equivalent exact tab-policy boundary explicit in P1.

6. **Rendered content:** bounded paragraphs/styles are a useful first milestone,
   but tables, tasks, code blocks and other supported Markdown/CSV view content
   cannot silently disappear or fall back to source. Typed unsupported-content
   refusal is acceptable in an interim profile; it does not complete rendered
   printing. Track the missing block types independently of a plain-print pass.

7. **Limits:** 64 MiB preflight, 64 KiB paragraphs, page/glyph/font/spool limits are
   proposed provider admission bounds. They are not owner-chosen editing limits.
   Report the named exceeded resource before submission and preserve the previous
   preview/source. A long paragraph cannot be split at an arbitrary byte/grapheme
   merely to satisfy a quota. No numeric default or bounded input by itself proves
   responsiveness, cancellability or full long-line support.

## Required evidence before SwiftEdit integration is called available

Require an independently installed matching SDK with capability/limit queries;
the provider owns the exact native backend subset. Apple silicon/macOS26 is the
owner's immediate dogfood platform. Keep Windows/Linux support explicit rather
than inheriting it from portable model tests.

Use the source cases generated by `Prepare-DocumentView-Fixtures.py` for control
collisions, invalid bytes, CRLF, long contexts and large-file admission. Add print
oracles only after font bytes, page geometry and projection version are frozen.
Verify preview/print plan equality, zoom invariance, final native ticket geometry,
selection snapshots, stale completions, busy/reservation failure, owner close and
source loss. Test fake-spool failure/cancel/unknown receipts before any native
submission. Native dialog ownership, cancellation, page-range/settings fidelity
and observed spool acceptance each need their own evidence. Do not print physical
test pages without a coordinated fixture destination.

## Owned source checkpoint, 2026-10-02

`SourceSnapshot` and `SnapshotCapture` now provide the Session-side owned copy
strategy discussed above. A capture checks ordered, disjoint source ranges and
caller-supplied byte, part and chunk quotas before allocating metadata. Stepping
copies at most the requested 1..65536 bytes into owned 64 KiB chunks, checking
document identity, revision and size. Only a completed, revalidated capture can
transfer its immutable owner. Failed reads, stale publication and cancellation
release unpublished storage. Explicit part boundaries retain discontiguous
selections without inserting or inventing source bytes.

Completed snapshots retain provenance and support bounded reads independently of
Session lifetime and subsequent file replacement. Capture executes on the Session
executor; only the completed immutable owner may be handed to workers through a
properly synchronized publication boundary. No live Session or file handle is
retained by the result. The owner must remain alive during concurrent reads.

These quotas count logical bytes and metadata slots, not allocator committed
memory. Metadata reservation, allocation, file reads and releasing accumulated
chunks are synchronous; a byte budget is not a wall-clock latency guarantee.
Paged capture relies on the source adapter's consistency checks. In particular,
POSIX metadata checks cannot establish a filesystem-atomic snapshot against all
uncooperative writers. Completed storage is immutable; capture must not advertise
a stronger external-file consistency guarantee than its adapter provides.

Tests cover exact controls, malformed bytes and line endings; multiple separate
parts and empty parts; quota/range refusal; stale revision and identity; partial
publication refusal; cancellation; and an actual 16 MiB paged source whose
completed snapshot survives closing Session and replacing the file. A POSIX-only
test additionally changes the backing file during capture and requires failure
without publication. Native CI must exercise that platform-specific branch.

Status: the Session source-copy foundation is implemented. GUI Document capture,
projection, native preview, print jobs and an installed print service remain
unfinished. This checkpoint does not make printing available or close the full
large-document printing requirement.
